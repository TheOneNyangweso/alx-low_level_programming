# $@ below matches the target - school in this case 
# $< above/below matches the 1st prerequisite. If the target is derived from an implicit rule, $< corresponds
# to the first prerequisite added by that implicit rule.

# spaces. Useful for handling only changed prerequisites.
# $^: Holds the names of all prerequisites (including duplicates), separated by spaces.
